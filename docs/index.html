<h2 align="middle">Abstract</h2>
    <p>
        Our goal in going “Beyond One Black Hole” was to render black holes scenes that were more complex than any we could find online, including dual black hole systems, systems with other proximal celestial objects, and scenes from non-stationary perspectives. We decided that building on top of an existing
        code base would allow us to explore these complexities, and by building up from the starless project by ratonels, we were able to focus on our creative goals. Our modifications enable the user to render multiple black holes of varying radii, render rotating black holes, add nearby celestial objects, and
        generate gifs of black holes as they are seen from varying perspectives.

<h2 align="middle">Kerr Black Hole</h2>
    <p>Because implementing high-fidelity rotation would necessitate a complete change in coordinates and the reworking for many integration shortcuts that the original author,
        rantonels, used, we decided to implement a less accurate but more performant version of rotation. We specified a distance range outside of the event horizon to be rotated,
        and added perpendicular forces to velocity in order to get a spiral effect. We also tried blending two separate renders, a Schwarzschild black hole and an unrealistic “spiral”
        black hole, via the Python Image Library, but the features weren’t powerful enough to combine images with anything other than alpha values and simple masks.</p>
